Models for predicting next Rubik's cube solving world record.

This repo contains a jupyter notebook with the models created and a .zip file with all data used for model creation.

The regression models predict next rubik's cubes speedsolving world records based on how many months has passed between the records (this historical data is found on World Cube Association's website and in the .csv files zipped).

It also has a take on the Facebook Prophet Time Series prediction, same data used.

Unzip "data.zip" and paste the files in same directory as the .ipynb file.

More info can be read in the notebook.

Thank you for visiting this repo ;)
